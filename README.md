See [this doc](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for full details on how to contribute!

### Formatting and Linting

```bash
# Verify files are formatted correctly
npm run check-format

# If formatting issues...
npm run format

# Make sure no linting errors
npm run lint-err-only

# Make sure no TypeScript errors
npm run tsc-check
```

## Building the App

Make sure to run `npm install` before trying the steps below!

### Web Version

**Building using this method for general development is highly recommended over the iOS and Android methods,** it's much easier to debug and inspect changes. Running the app with iOS and Android simulators is only recommended to double-check that the changes you made are compatible with both platforms.

Start server:

```bash
npm run start
```

The app should then be available at http://localhost:5173/

### iOS and Android Simulators (with Hot Reload)

If below doesn't work, check that network URL after displayed after running `npm run start-exposed` matches the URL in the _capacitor.config.ts_ file

Start server in one terminal:

```bash
npm run start-exposed
```

Then run the script for the platform in another terminal:

#### iOS

```bash
npm run ios-live-reload
```

You can then select the type of iOS device you'd like to use as a simulator

##### To view debug info (inspect elements, view console output)

- If you've never done this before, you'll likely have to the make sure "Show features for web developers" is enabled under Safari's Settings

  <img src="./resources/debugging-screenshots/safari-web-dev-settings.png" width="200" alt="Safari settings displaying Show features for web developers setting" />

- Open Safari and click the iOS simulator for Hakubun under Develop -> iOS device you chose as simulator -> IP address displayed. _If this is not displayed, make sure you followed the previous step. If it's still not displayed, opening Xcode can sometimes make it appear_

  <img src="./resources/debugging-screenshots/safari-inspecting-ios-device.png" width="200" alt="inspecting iOS simulator" />

#### Android

```bash
npm run android-live-reload
```

##### To view debug info (inspect elements, view console output)

- In Chrome, go to chrome://inspect/#devices
- An address should be available under "Remote Target", you can click on "inspect" to bring up a web inspector. This can be used to inspect elements and view console output

## Testing

### Unit Testing

To run all unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Device Testing for Android, iOS, etc.

This project is tested with BrowserStack

### Running Fastlane

[Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) is a tool used to build and deploy the Android and iOS apps for Hakubun.
**Note: it's unlikely you'll need to know this info, just used for GitHub workflows/CICD**

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

#### Running Lanes

To run android lanes:

```bash
fastlane android <LANE>
```

To run iOS lanes:

```bash
fastlane ios <LANE>
```
